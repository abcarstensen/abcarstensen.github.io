I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow working with Mike Frank in the [Language and Cognition Lab](http://langcog.stanford.edu) at Stanford University. I'm interested broadly in how humans abstract away from the sensory information they receive about the world to create, structure, and communicate higher-level representations. To better understand these processes, my research explores the nature of category systems across languages: how these semantic structures vary, evolve, and influence thought. In a complementary line of work, I examine the role of language and culture in children's developing conceptualizations of space and relations.

I completed my PhD in psychology at UC Berkeley, in Terry Regier's [Language and Cognition Lab](http://lclab.berkeley.edu), and a postdoc in Asifa Majid's [Meaning, Culture, and Cognition Lab](http://meaningculturecognition.ruhosting.nl) at Radboud University in the Netherlands.
